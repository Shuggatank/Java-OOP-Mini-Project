# Java-OOP-Mini-Project

Feature Requirements

Your game must:

  - [x] Have a main menu with options to enter 2 players or vs. computer.
  - [x] If the user enters 2 players, they should be able to play rock–paper–scissors against a human competitor.
  - [x] If the user enters vs. computer, they should be able to play against the computer.
  - [x] When the game is over, the winner should be declared.

Technical Requirements

  - [x] Use classes to remove repetitive parts of code, and create an abstract Player class to manage the state of the player (if they won or lost, how many points they have, what move they made).
  - [x] Handle invalid user input.
  - [x] Handle incorrect capitalization of otherwise valid user input ("rock," "Rock," "RoCk," "ROCK," and more).
  - [x] Each class (including a Player class) should have methods associated with it and be instantiated as an object (as opposed to a singleton or an interface).
  - [x] Use public, private, and static variables, methods, and members within each class appropriately.
  - [x] Incorporate exception handling to make sure your game crashes gracefully if it receives bad input.
  - [x] Get standard input with Java using a Scanner, or use Processing to get mouse, keyboard, or other input.
  - [x] Use arrays or array lists to store game history (if applicable).

Bonus Ideas

  - [ ] Write automated JUnit tests for your application.
  - [ ] Use an Agile project management framework for your game.
  - [x] If the user enters history, the program should display previous game history (winner's name, game date, and more).
  - [ ] Use Java packages to modularize code. Place any helper tools in these packages — they could be related input, networking, or graphics.
  - [ ] Use Maven to install external dependencies your game might require.
  - [ ] Use generics on collections such as arrays and array lists to store different data composed of different types.
  - [ ] Use multithreading to handle concurrent requests (like in multiplayer games).
  - [ ] Incorporate video, text, data, networking, and sound into your game via Processing.
